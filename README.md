# Note Taker

## About

The Note Taker application is a browser-based app that uses a Node server to store notes indefinitely for a user! The server listens for the user to make a request, most commonly in the form of retrieving ('get') notes from the server, and writing ('post') new notes to the server. The user can reload the page at any time to get previously stored notes, and they can also click the trash icon to delete any unwanted notes. 

## Screenshots


The user is greeted with a clean landing page.
